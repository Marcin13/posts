### Generating and Using an SSH Key for Secure Server Access

To generate a strong SSH key, run the following command:
```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ansible"
```

You will be prompted to choose a folder and name for the SSH key:
```shell
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/marcin/.ssh/id_ed25519): /home/marcin/.ssh/ansible/ansible
```
Next, copy the SSH key to the server(s) you want to access. However, before you do so, you must first log in to the server(s) using your name and password:
```shell
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ansible.pub <IP Adderss>
```

Once you have copied the SSH key to the server, you can use it to connect securely:
```shell
ssh -i .ssh/<key_name> <IP Address>
```

To cache the passphrase for your session, you can use the ssh-agent:
```shell
eval $(ssh-agent) &&b ssh-add
```

Hereâ€™s an alias you can add to your .bashrc file to simplify the process:
```shell
alias ssha='eval $(ssh-agent) && ssh-add'
```

### Conclusion:
Generating and using SSH keys can greatly enhance the security and convenience of remote server access. With the steps
outlined above, users can create a strong SSH key, copy it to the desired server(s), and use it to establish secure connections. 
Additionally, the use of ssh-agent and aliases can simplify the process and make it more efficient.
By following these best practices, users can mitigate the risks associated with traditional username/password authentication 
methods and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their systems.
