#### The Dell™ PowerEdge™ T610 server is a key data center building block for IT professionals seeking the highest level of performance, availability, and expandability in a 2-socket server.
Ideally suited for small and medium businesses and remote office
customers, the T610 delivers enhanced virtualization, improved
design, and energy efficiency in a server engineered to address
both your current and future business needs

#### Strong IT foundation

A solid IT foundation is critical for business success. The Dell
PowerEdge T610 contributes to your IT foundation by offering
many of the virtualization, system management, and usability
capabilities you need while providing impressive power and
thermals for overall energy efficiency. This mainstream two socket
Intel™ based tower server includes a rack-mount option and
supports mission critical applications and data processing.
#### Purposeful design

The T610 takes advantage of Dell’s system commonality. Once
your IT managers learn one system, they understand how to
manage next-generation Dell servers. Logical component layout
and power supply placement also provide a straightforward
installation and redeployment experience. Inspired by IT
professionals, the T610 is built to simplify daily operations and
maximize uptime.
In addition, Dell PowerEdge servers provide a graphical and
interactive LCD for system health monitoring, alerting, and control
of basic management configuration right in the front of the server.
Customers have an AC power meter and ambient temperature
thermometer built into the server that they can monitor on this
display without any software tools

#### Energy-optimized technology
Using the latest Energy Smart technologies, the T610 helps reduce
power consumption while increasing performance capacity
over previous generations of Dell towers. Enhancements include
efficient power supply units right-sized for system requirements,
effective system-level design efficiency, policy-driven power and
thermal management, and highly efficient standards-based Energy
Smart components.
These features are designed to maximize energy usage across
our latest core data center servers without compromising
performance.
#### Advanced virtualization
Featuring Intel® Xeon® processor 5500 and 5600 series,
embedded hypervisors, 100% integrated I/O, and up to 100% more
memory capacity than the previous server generations, the Dell
PowerEdge T610 delivers better overall system performance and
greater virtual machine-per-server capacity than ever before.
With optional factory-integrated virtualization capabilities, you
get tailored solutions—built with the latest industry-standard
technologies from Dell and our trusted partners—which allow
you to streamline deployment and simplify virtual infrastructures.
Choose your hypervisor from market leaders such as VMware,
Citrix, and Microsoft, and enable virtualization with a few mouse
clicks.

#### Simplified systems management
The Dell OpenManage™ suite offers enhanced operations and
standards-based commands designed to integrate with existing
systems for effective control.

#### Lifecycle controller
Lifecycle Controller is the engine for advanced systems'
management integrated on the server. Lifecycle Controller
simplifies administrator tasks to perform a complete set of
provisioning functions such as system deployment, system
updates, hardware configuration and diagnostics from a single
intuitive interface called Unified Server Configurator (USC) in a
pre-OS environment. This eliminates the need to use and maintain
multiple pieces of disparate CD/DVD media.
Also part of the OpenManage systems management portfolio is
the Dell Management Console, included with every Dell server,
which provides IT managers with a consolidated view of their
entire IT infrastructure.

#### Dell Services
Dell Services can help reduce IT complexity, lower costs, and
eliminate inefficiencies by making IT and business solutions work
harder for you. The Dell Services team takes a holistic view of your
needs and designs solutions for your environment and business
objectives while leveraging proven delivery methods, local talent,
and in-depth domain knowledge for the lowest TCO.
